Engineered a comprehensive data pipeline in Excel (Power Query, pivot tables, VLOOKUP), applying seasonal‑trend and feature‑selection techniques on longitudinal employee data—uncovering key retention drivers like onboarding timing, training engagement, and seasonal spikes in absenteeism—enabling proactive workforce planning, targeted interventions, and policy optimization.

Developed an interactive Power BI HR Analytics Dashboard, integrating cleaned Excel data with advanced DAX measures (e.g., weighted attrition‑risk percentiles, avg. time‑to‑hire, training hours per employee), featuring demographic heatmaps, seasonal absence/training trend plots, KPI scorecards, and drill-down filters by department, role, and tenure—empowering HR leaders and managers to monitor workforce health in near real‑time and tailor recruitment, retention, and development strategies dynamically.
